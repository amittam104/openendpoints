# Current Context

## Current State

The project is in its initial phase. It is a new Next.js application generated with `create-next-app`. The basic setup for authentication with `better-auth` and database with `Prisma` and `MongoDB` is in place. The data models for `Workspace`, `Project`, and `Endpoint` have been implemented in the Prisma schema, and type mismatch issues have been resolved. The create project UI has been implemented following the established design system.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps involve building the core features of the application as defined in the MVP. This includes:

1.  Finalizing the route structure (completed).
2.  Creating the UI for the simple endpoint builder.
3.  Developing the project workspace to manage projects and endpoints.
4.  Implementing the three output formats (Cards, Markdown, YAML).

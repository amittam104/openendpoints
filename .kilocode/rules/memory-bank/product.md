# Product Overview

## Core Idea

"openendpoints" is an open-source application designed to streamline the process of defining and sharing API endpoint specifications. It aims to bridge the communication gap between frontend and backend developers by providing a simple, user-friendly interface for creating and documenting API endpoints.

## Problem Solved

Frontend developers often struggle to communicate their API needs clearly to backend developers. This can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and inefficient development cycles. "openendpoints" solves this problem by providing a structured and intuitive way to define API endpoints, ensuring that both frontend and backend teams are on the same page.

## How It Works

1.  **Simple Endpoint Builder**: Developers can use a simple form to define endpoint details, including the name, HTTP method, URL path, and example request/response bodies.
2.  **Project Workspaces**: Endpoints can be organized into projects, allowing for better management and organization of APIs for different applications or websites.
3.  **Multiple Output Formats**: The application will generate three different views of the endpoint specifications:
    - **Cards View**: A clean, visual representation of each endpoint.
    - **Markdown Export**: A copy-pasteable format for documentation.
    - **YAML Export**: A simple, structured format for easy integration with other tools.
4.  **Basic Authentication and Persistence**: Users can sign up and log in to save their projects and manage them across sessions.

## User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity**: The user interface should be clean, intuitive, and easy to use, even for developers who are not familiar with API design.
- **Efficiency**: The application should help developers create and share API specifications quickly and efficiently.
- **Clarity**: The generated outputs should be easy to read and understand, ensuring that there is no ambiguity in the API specifications.
